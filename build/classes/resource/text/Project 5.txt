Project 5: The Formal Analytical Report
Read these instructions carefully.  You will participate in two peer reviews for this assignment.  Your final Project 5 is due at the end of this course.

Overview
Complete the formal analytical report that you described in Project 1 Proposal. The report must do the following:

define a problem,
analyze the criteria for a satisfactory solution,
propose one or more alternative solutions, and
argue for the solution that satisfies the criteria best.
The problem may involve an institutional, technical, or public policy issue that you are working on or have worked on in your other courses; or it may be something related to an organization to which you belong; or it may be related to a job that you've held or now hold; or it may be a new area that you are interested in.

The solution to the problem may involve coming up with an original design, choosing between available alternatives, or providing needed information. See this report as a kind of "final exam" for our course-a place to demonstrate everything that you've learned about writing in this course.

Details
The Rhetorical Situation
For the purposes of this report, you should find a real situation in which you are writing the report to a primary reader who has the authority to reject or use your work. So the primary goal of your report is to convince this reader to adopt your recommended solution(s). The report may also have secondary audiences as well; for example, it may serve as a plan for the technical staff who will implement the solution and as an historical record of the decision-making process for future readers.

The problem situation should be real. A real situation is one that you have actually encountered: it might involve a current or former employer, a specific office or department within the University, or a service group to which you belong.

Audience and Style
Your report should be written directly to a person within your real situation who has the authority to decide whether to accept your recommendations. Your tone should be appropriate to the situation--in most cases it will be fairly formal.

Body of Report
All reports should introduce a problem, analyze criteria for a solution, evaluate several solutions against the criteria, and recommend the best solution(s).

Prefatory and Supplemental Elements
Your report should include the following:

a letter or memo of transmittal
a cover page
a title page
an executive summary
a table of contents
at least two visuals
references
appendices
Length
Your report should be as long as it needs to be, but will probably run about 8  pages (2,000 words), excluding the front and end matter. I would prefer that you keep it under 20 pages (5,000 words).
